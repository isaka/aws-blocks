### Patch Changes

- 162c47d: fix(hosting): stop hardcoding image-optimization Lambda reserved concurrency

  The image-optimization Lambda hardcoded `reservedConcurrency: 10`, which made `cdk deploy` fail on fresh AWS accounts (the default account-level unreserved-concurrency limit is also 10, so reserving all 10 drops the account below its required minimum and Lambda returns a 400). It now defaults to no reservation and exposes `compute.imageOptimization.reservedConcurrency` so operators with headroom can still cap it.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 42adb51: Fix multi-page routing for static sites (Astro static, SSGs). The L3 no longer infers SPA-vs-multi-page from the presence of error pages; adapters now declare `staticAssets.spaFallback` explicitly. The Astro adapter sets `spaFallback: false` (static Astro is always multi-page), and the generic adapter sources it from the framework contract (`spa` → single-page, `static` → multi-page). Multi-page static sites without their own `404.html` now get a built-in default 404 page (served at HTTP 404) instead of CloudFront's raw error. Adds a `hosting-ssr-astro` e2e test app.

  **Migration**: If you were passing `framework: 'static'` and relied on SPA-fallback routing (extensionless paths → /index.html), switch to `framework: 'spa'`. `framework: 'static'` now always produces multi-page directory-index resolution.

- 061a0b2: fix(hosting): make redeploys atomic by uploading assets before the CloudFront build-id cutover, eliminating the 403 window for new visitors during deployment
