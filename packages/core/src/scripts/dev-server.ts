  // ── Frontend supervisor ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
  // The frontend runs under `shell: true`, so the real dev server (Vite) is a
  // grandchild of this process. We spawn it `detached` (its own process group)
  // on POSIX so cleanup/restart can signal the *whole* tree and free the port;
  // otherwise the orphaned grandchild keeps `:3100` and every `/` request 502s
  // forever (the proxy target is hardcoded to `frontendPort`). We also bound-
  // respawn it on unexpected death and suppress all of this during shutdown.
  //
  // ── POST-EXIT GROUP-KILL POLICY ─────────────────────────────────────────
  // The exact bug this supervisor fixes is the shell *exiting* while the
  // detached grandchild survives, orphaned, still holding `:3100`. Reaping that
  // orphan REQUIRES a group kill (`process.kill(-pid, …)`) issued *after* the
  // shell has already exited — so all three post-exit kill sites below agree:
  // the respawn path, `terminateFrontend`, and the `process.on('exit')` net all
  // group-kill rather than skip when the shell is already gone.
  //
  // Why this is safe against the classic `-pid` PID-reuse hazard:
  //   1. A surviving grandchild keeps the process group non-empty, so POSIX
  //      keeps `pid` reserved as the group id — it cannot be recycled as a new
  //      process id while it is still a live group's id. Hence `-pid` is
  //      guaranteed to target *our* group precisely when it matters (an orphan
  //      is still alive in it).
  //   2. We only ever issue the kill synchronously, the instant we observe the
  //      shell's exit — there is no intervening `await` that could let the group
  //      drain and the pid be recycled — so the residual window is minimal.
  // Residual accepted risk: if the ENTIRE group is already gone *and* `pid` has
  // since been recycled into a brand-new group leader, `-pid` could signal an
  // unrelated group. This is an accepted best-effort trade-off — there is then
  // nothing of ours left to reap, whereas skipping the kill would otherwise
  // leave `:3100` wedged, which is the failure this PR exists to prevent.
  //
  // Where each post-exit kill site lands on this trade-off: the two sites *in
  // this file* — the respawn reap (in the child's `exit` handler) and the
  // `process.on('exit')` net — fire synchronously the instant we observe the
  // exit, so they lean on point (2) above and stay unconditional. The third
  // path, `terminateFrontend` → `terminateProcessTree` (process-tree.ts), can
  // run outside that minimal synchronous window, so it additionally PROBES group
  // liveness (POSIX signal 0) and skips the reap once the group has fully
  // drained — see its "POST-EXIT GROUP-KILL (scoped)" comment.
