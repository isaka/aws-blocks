## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 162c47d: fix(hosting): stop hardcoding image-optimization Lambda reserved concurrency

  The image-optimization Lambda hardcoded `reservedConcurrency: 10`, which made `cdk deploy` fail on fresh AWS accounts (the default account-level unreserved-concurrency limit is also 10, so reserving all 10 drops the account below its required minimum and Lambda returns a 400). It now defaults to no reservation and exposes `compute.imageOptimization.reservedConcurrency` so operators with headroom can still cap it.

- Updated dependencies [162c47d]

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- a306ff1: Serve `/.blocks-sandbox/config.json` from the dev server itself instead of proxying it to the framework dev server.

  The browser auth client resolves its API URL by fetching `/.blocks-sandbox/config.json`. The dev server proxied that request to the framework dev server (Next.js/Nuxt/Astro), which only serves its own static dir and returned 404 — so the client failed with "Blocks API URL not configured" in local `dev`. The dev server now answers this reserved path directly, mirroring production where CloudFront serves `/.blocks-sandbox/*` as static assets. Framework-agnostic and requires no per-app workaround.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- e98bab4: feat(pipeline): extract Pipeline construct into @aws-blocks/pipeline package, add partialBuildSpec for CodeBuild runtime control

  `@aws-blocks/core` receives a minor bump (not patch): it gains a new runtime dependency on `@aws-blocks/pipeline` and adds new public re-exports from its CDK entrypoint (`__PIPELINE_STAGE_SCOPE__`, `Pipeline`, `DeployStage`, and the pipeline configuration types). New backwards-compatible public surface is a minor change per semver.

- Updated dependencies [e98bab4]
  - @aws-blocks/pipeline@0.1.1

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 18880ff: Fix `deploy`, `sandbox`, and `destroy` failing on Windows: spawn `npm`/`npx`/`cdk` via `cross-spawn` (resolves the `.cmd` shims) and import the backend through a `file://` URL so absolute paths like `D:\...` work during CDK synth.
