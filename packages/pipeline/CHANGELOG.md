### Patch Changes

- e98bab4: feat(pipeline): extract Pipeline construct into @aws-blocks/pipeline package, add partialBuildSpec for CodeBuild runtime control

  `@aws-blocks/core` receives a minor bump (not patch): it gains a new runtime dependency on `@aws-blocks/pipeline` and adds new public re-exports from its CDK entrypoint (`__PIPELINE_STAGE_SCOPE__`, `Pipeline`, `DeployStage`, and the pipeline configuration types). New backwards-compatible public surface is a minor change per semver.
