/**
 * TLS config for the library's **operational** (non-runtime) connections to an
 * external database: `db pull` schema introspection, the migrate CLI, the
 * pg_dump version check, and the external-migration runner.
 *
 * These are short-lived connections opened from the developer / CI host (session
 * port 5432) using a connection string the operator just supplied. They verify
 * the server certificate when a CA is available and otherwise fall back to an
 * encrypted-but-unverified connection.
 *
 * Providers like Supabase present a certificate signed by a private CA
 * (Supabase ships `prod-ca-2021`, downloadable from Database Settings → SSL
 * Configuration) that is not in Node's built-in trust store, so verification
 * requires pinning that CA. Supply it via `DATABASE_CA_CERT` as either an inline
 * PEM string or a path to a `.crt`/`.pem` file. When set, the connection is
 * verified end-to-end (equivalent to `sslmode=verify-full`).
 *
 * Note: for the CA to take effect, any `sslmode` must be stripped from the URL —
 * node `pg` verifies against the system trust store and ignores a programmatic
 * `ssl.ca` when `sslmode` is present in the connection string. The callers in
 * this package already normalize the URL before connecting.
 *
 * When no CA is configured the connection is encrypted but unverified. That is an
 * acceptable default for an interactive operator connecting to their own database,
 * but a privileged automated path (CI/CD migrations applying DDL) should not run
 * unverified silently — so in a non-interactive run (`CI` set) this throws unless
 * the caller explicitly opts in via `allowUnverifiedInCi` (used by first-pull
 * introspection, which by definition runs before a CA has been captured).

 * `CI=false` / `CI=0` opt-out strings as interactive. Limitation: a pipeline or
 * deploy host that does not set `CI` is treated as interactive, so the unverified
 * fallback still applies there — set `DATABASE_CA_CERT` to guarantee verification
 * in any automated run.
