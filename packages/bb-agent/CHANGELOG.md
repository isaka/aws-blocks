# @aws-blocks/bb-agent

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ce61bb7: refactor(bb-agent): capability-based model presets with global inference profiles

  New presets:

  - `BALANCED` (Claude Sonnet 4.6): recommended default for most workloads
  - `SMART` (Claude Opus 4.8): highest capability for hardest tasks
  - `FAST` (Claude Haiku 4.5): lowest latency

  All presets use `global.` inference profiles for region-agnostic deployment.

  Deprecated (non-removing): `DEFAULT` resolves to `BALANCED`, `BUDGET` and `MICRO` resolve to `FAST`. Note this changes the underlying model for existing callers — `DEFAULT` moves from Opus to Sonnet, and `BUDGET`/`MICRO` move from Amazon Nova Pro/Lite to Claude Haiku, so cost and latency profiles differ. The symbols still resolve (no type break), but migrate to `BALANCED`/`FAST` (or a region-scoped profile) explicitly to pin the model you want.

### Patch Changes

- f946736: fix(bb-agent): treat empty channelId as unset in stream()

  An empty `channelId` now falls back to `conversationId` or a random UUID, preventing all streams from sharing the same channel. Empty strings are treated as unset rather than used literally.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- ba3bf7b: docs: add per-package DESIGN.md documents

  Adds a `DESIGN.md` to each building-block package describing its architecture, API surface, mock implementation, and key design decisions.

  - Each document is cross-checked against the current source so identifiers, environment variables, error names, and described behavior match the implementation.
  - Each `DESIGN.md` is listed in its package's `files` array so it ships on npm alongside `README.md`.
  - For consistency, `bb-auth-cognito`'s document lives at the package root like every other package.
  - Bumps the umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` package so its bundled `docs/` — assembled from these block READMEs at build time — republishes with a fresh version. Its packed content changes whenever the READMEs change, but the version was previously left untouched, which tripped the publish integrity guard.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 835c425: docs(bb-agent): document AgentStreamChunk types and Message roles
- dd07335: fix(bb-agent): simplify Bedrock health check to support all inference profile formats

  Removed the prefix regex that determined whether to call `GetInferenceProfile`
  or `GetFoundationModel`. The health check now tries both APIs sequentially —
  any model ID format (cross-region, global, or foundation model) works without
  maintaining a prefix allowlist.
